### Prerequisites

- Docker and Docker Compose installed on your system

### Environment Variables

The application uses the following environment variables that are set in the docker-compose.yaml file:

```yaml
environment:
  - NODE_ENV=production
  - AUTH_API_URL=http://auth-service:9193/api/v1
  - TASK_API_URL=http://task-service:9191/api/v1
```

### Running the Application

1. Clone the repository

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd frontend-service
   ```

2. Start the application with Docker Compose

   ```bash
   docker compose up -d
   ```

3. Access the application at http://localhost:81

### Test Credentials

- **Sign up users to test the system**
- **Example Admin User**:

  - Email: admin@example.com
  - Password: admin123

- **Example Regular User**:
  - Email: user@example.com
  - Password: user123

## Runtime Configuration

The application uses a runtime configuration approach that allows environment variables to be set when the Docker container starts, rather than being baked into the JavaScript at build time. This makes the application more flexible and easier to deploy in different environments.
