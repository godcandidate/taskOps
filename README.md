# TaskOps 🛠️

**TaskOps** is a microservices-based task management app designed as a personal DevOps playground. It's built to explore and practice cloud-native technologies including Kubernetes, Helm, CI/CD, observability, and more.

## 🚧 What is this?

A simple task management platform made up of multiple services:

- `identity` – Handles authentication, token management, and user profile management all in one service.
- `task` – Task creation, updates, and tracking
- `notification` – Handles sending notifications such as email

## 🎯 Goals

- Practice Kubernetes fundamentals (pods, deployments, services, etc.)
- Create and deploy Helm charts for each microservice
- Set up CI/CD pipelines using GitHub Actions
- Implement observability using Prometheus, Grafana, and Loki
- Experiment with tools like Lens, Helmfile, K9s, and more
- Follow 12-Factor App practices for cloud-native service design
